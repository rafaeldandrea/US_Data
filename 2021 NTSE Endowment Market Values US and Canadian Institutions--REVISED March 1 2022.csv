"Survey respondents highlighted in Orange are institutions that reported or edited their endowment values after the 2021 NTSE data collection period. Updated responses were included at the request of the survey respondents, but no other data for these institutions are not included in the NTSE.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Canada institutions are in Green. Endowment market value data for Canadian institutions are expressed in U.S. dollars, based on the U.S./Canadian dollar conversion rates in effect on or around June 30, 2021 (for FY21) and June 30, 2020 (for FY20), as reported by the Bank of Canada Web site (https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/exchange/). Data from Canadian institutions are NOT included in the full 2021 NTSE report.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. The change in market values listed for the participating institutions DOES NOT represent the investment rate of return for the endowments’ investments. Rather, the change in the market value of an endowment from FY20 to FY21 reflects the net impact of:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
    1) withdrawals to fund institutional operations and capital expenses;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
    2) the payment of endowment management and investment fees;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
    3) additions from donor gifts and other contributions; and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
    4) investment gains or losses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The market values also include the estimated valuations of real estate and other “illiquid” assets, which may have large increases or decreases in value during a relatively short period of time. In addition, transfers to the endowment from other institutional budget accounts, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates for non-U.S. investments, may account for large changes in endowment market values. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These factors suggest that any large increases or decreases in endowments over the past year may be exaggerated. As such, large percentage changes should be interpreted very cautiously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
